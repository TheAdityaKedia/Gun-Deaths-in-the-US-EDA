# Exploratory Data Analysis of Gun Deaths in the US

This project presents an exploratory analysis of the data on gun deaths in the US over a five year period (2012-2013), using R-Markdown. The data were obtained from the CDC and parsed using and R script obtained through fiveThirtyEight.com's [project on the same issue](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data). The files included in this repo are as follows.

- `README.md` -> This file
- `Gun_deaths_in_the_US.html` -> an HTML report of the analysis generated through r-markdown that shows several visualizations and highlights some findings trhough them
- `Gun_deaths_in_the_US.rmd` -> an R-Markdown document that contains the code to actually carry out the analysis
- `fiveThirtyEight_script_for_CDC_Mortality_Data.R` -> an R script obtained through fiveTiretyEight to download, clean and parse data from the [CDC's Multiple Cause of Death datafile](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/VitalStatsOnline.htm#Mortality_Multiple)
- `full_data.csv` -> cleaned gun-death data from the CDC for 2012-2016
